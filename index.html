            <p>Origin of Origami</p>
            
            <h3><br>There are many plausible assertions about its origins and early history, but most of those are based on 
            little firm documentation. Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand 
            years ago, but its roots may well be in China.
             It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented.
            Origami is Japanese technique of folding paper. In Japanese language it is "ori" meaning "folding" and
            "kami" meaning "paper".The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through 
            folding and sculpting techniques.

                            Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a 'binky', when they're happy — performing twists and kicks in mid air!

                        <li>
                            Rabbits’ eyes are on the sides of their head, meaning they can see almost all the way around them. This helps them to keep a close watch for predators while they’re going about their business!
